## Lyft 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles-YOLOv3

Object detection is a task in computer vision that focuses on detecting objects in images. "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) based Convolutional Neural Network is a well-known algorithm for object detection achieving state-of-the-art results because of its high accuracy and being able to detect object in real time. At this moment, Yolov5 is the latest and best one for object detection.
